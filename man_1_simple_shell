.SH NAME
simple_shell - simple command interpreter (sash)
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "sash.h"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple_shell program processes: file paths, executables located in the users PATH variable, and basic built-in commands. The program, simple_shell, writes output to stdout and errors to stderr. This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell.

.SH OVERVIEW
The simple_shell is a command that reads lines from the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.

.SS Invocation
An "interactive" shell reads commands from a user input. When a shell is in interactive mode, it displays a prompt and runs a process after the user types enter. When a shell is running a script it is said to be in non-interactive mode. That said, the user can emulate interactive mode by running a script that takes input from a user. Simple_shell (sash) runs in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

.SS Example
.br
./test
.br
#!/bin/bash
.br
echo "please enter your name: "
.br
read var1
.br
echo "Hello, "$var1""
.br
Output:
.br
please enter your name:
.br
tiger
.br
Hello, tiger

.SS Commands
The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language, the specification of which is outside the scope of this man page (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2 document). Essentially though, a line is read and the first word of the line is processed. The input will either be processed as an executable, a built-in function, or an error message will be sent to stdout.

.SS Path Search
 When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name. It does this by searching through each directory provided in the users PATH variable. If no executable is found, the shell looks for a builtin command by that name. If a builtin command is not found, and error message is printed and the user is prompted to enter another command.

.SS Builtins
This section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because they need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a separate process.
.br
cd [directory]
.br
Switch to the specified directory.
.br
Exit
.br
Leave current shell process.
.br
Env
.br
Display your current environment.
.br

.SS Exit Status
Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a zero exit status.  If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.  Otherwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.
